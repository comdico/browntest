				<h2>What is semantic HTML?</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Semantic HTML defines the structure of web documents so that it's markup adds contextual meaning to it that can improve comprehansion by humans as well as machines. Semantic markup can both help structure a document at the macro level by using the HTML outline model to create the correct document structure, and through the use of specific tags (HTML and micro-formats) that help define a dopcument's meaning at the micro level. </p>

				<h2>What is accessibility?</h2>
			</header>
			<p>HTML documents should be accessible be as many devices as possible, including screen readers. Many people in the world still access web content via older browsers or cell phones with older embedded browsers.</p>
			<p>Accessibility for screen readers is best acheived by incorporating WAI-ARIA attributes, which help define a page's structure for specialized web-clients for people with disabilities.</p>
			<p>The WAI-ARIA spec is now a formal part of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/dom.html#wai-aria">W3C specification.</a></p>

			</header>
			<p>Progressive enhancement is a strategy for building webpages that are semantic, accessible, and work in as many browsers as possible. </p>
			<p>As oppossed to graceful degradation, which treats accessibility from the standpoint of a finished site with all the bells and whistles, progressive enhancement, builds the core product with the most basic of tools, and then adds enhancements, such as CSS3 and Javascript to layer in complex functionality</p>
			<p>Responsive design and content-out is an out growth of progressive enhancement.  </p>
