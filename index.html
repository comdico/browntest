				<h2>What is semantic HTML?</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Semantic HTML is a term used to describe the markup of web documents that follows the best practice of separating content from presentation. Such documents avoid the extraneous use of unnecessary html tags in favor of markup that lends contextual and structural meaning, which can improve comprehension by humans as well as machines.</p>

				<h2>What is accessibility?</h2>
			</header>
			<p>HTML documents should be accessible to as many devices as possible, including screen readers. World-wide, many users still access web content with aging desktops or cell phones with older embedded browsers. Semantic HTML helps ensure a page's accessibility.</p>
			<p>Accessibility for screen readers is best achieved by incorporating WAI-ARIA attributes, which define a page's structure in terms understood by specialized web-clients for people with disabilities.</p>
			<p>The WAI-ARIA spec is now a formal part of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/dom.html#wai-aria">W3C specification.</a></p>

				<h2>What is progressive enhancement?</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Progressive enhancement is a strategy for building webpages that are semantic, accessible, and agile. </p>
			<p>As opposed to graceful degradation, which achieves accessibility by working backwards from a finished site with all the bells and whistles, progressive enhancement builds the core product with the most basic of tools, iteratively enhancing the feature set as needed to layer in more complex functionality.</p>
			<p>Progressive enhancement can be thought of as the parent of Responsive Design and works nicely with agile and Responsive workflows.</p>
